- **Warehouse Details**: Shows detailed information about a selected warehouse.
- **Image Display**: Displays warehouse images in small, medium, or large sizes based on available space.

## Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/warehouse-management-app.git

### 3. Add Images

Place your warehouse images in the `public/images/` directory. Ensure they are organized into `small/`, `medium/`, and `large/` folders:

### 4. Update Warehouse Data

Ensure your `warehouses.json` file includes the `image` field with the correct image filenames:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Warehouse 1",
    "city": "City A",
    "cluster": "Cluster X",
    "space_available": 1500,
    "is_live": true,
    "image": "warehouse1_medium.jpg",
    "customFields": ["Custom Field 1"]
  }
]
```

```bash
npm start
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to view the application.
